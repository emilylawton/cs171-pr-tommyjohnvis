# Design Studio Feedback 

We collaborated during the design studio with **Cynthia Meng** and **Hugh Zabriskie**. 

### Feedback 

The feedback we received during the design studio was generally positive. The comments we were both fair and constructive. Cynthia and Hugh were not familiar with Tommy John surgery and its popularity among baseball pitchers - attesting to the fact that the general public (one user-type we are concerned with in developing our visualization) is not aware of this phenomenon. 

Specific ideas that were brought up during our discussion are as follows: 
 
* Being able to interact with `countVis` (our main visual that shows the number of surgeries performed as a function of time) and select individual surgery instancies was well received. This addition to what would otherwise be a simple bar chart enables viewers to explore specific information (recovery time, surgery date, surgeons, etc.) for individual players. 
* We discussed the pros and cons of presenting our visualization as a story versus as a single compact set of views that does not require any scrolling.  
* One last thought that Cynthia and Hugh brought up was that we could extend our project to not focus solely on Tommy John surgeries but to also consider other injuries to baseball players as well. This would involve changing our `playerVis` to include a timeline of injuries. 


### Going Forward

As we continue developing our visualization, we will come back to the feedback we received during the design studio to further iterate upon our design. As for whether or not we ultimately decide to present our visualization as a story, we anticipate that an interesting narrative will become more clear as our visualizations become more developed. In regards to the comment to generalize our project to incorporate all sports-related injuries, we think that given the timeframe we have to complete the project, we will keep the scope limited to Tommy John surgeries.
